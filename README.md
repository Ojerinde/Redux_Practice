## Introduction

I built this site just to practice my Redux tool skill
* I built my custom action creator object.
* I make use of Rest Countries API.
* I used Firebase backend to test out the async request

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development 

The prerequite tool for local development is:
* Node

### Frontend
The app is built with React so there is need to install the frontend dependencies using Node.js and NPM

You can confirm if Node.js and NPM is installed successfully using the codes below

```
node -v
npm -v
```

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client: 

```
npm install # run this once to install dependencies
npm start 
```

By default, the frontend will run on `localhost:3000`. 


## Deployment
The app is deployed on Netlify
