## Introduction

Redux_Practice App is an app I built to practice my Redux tool skill after taking a course on it.

In the App,
* I used regular expression to validate the input field.(integer type is not allowed)
* I built my custom action creator object.(I chose fat reducer above fat component)
* I make use of Rest Countries API to fetch the searched country.
* I used Firebase Realtime database as my backend.
* I also put into practice React Architectural design.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development 

The prerequite tool for local development is:
* Node

### Frontend
The app is built with React so there is need to install the frontend dependencies using Node.js and NPM

You can confirm if Node.js and NPM is installed successfully using the codes below

```
node -v
npm -v
```

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client: 

```
npm install # run this once to install dependencies
npm start 
```

By default, the frontend will run on `localhost:3000`. 


## Deployment
The app is deployed on [Netlify]("https://redux-jo-el.netlify.app/")
